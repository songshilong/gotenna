    <string name="faq_default_category_encryption_q1">Are messages encrypted?~~~Private group and 1–to–1 messages are automatically encrypted as they are enabled by public/private (PKI) encryption key exchanges. Broadcast encryption can be activated through the encryption menu in Settings.</string>
    <string name="faq_default_category_encryption_q2">"How do I encrypt broadcast messages?~~~There are 3 steps to creating and sharing encryption keys: 
\u00091. Generate key
\u00092. Share key
\u00093. Validate key

Navigate to Settings> Encryption. To generate an AES 256 key, click the “+” button and select to generate a new encryption key. Enter a key name (the key name is not the actual encryption key), and you will be prompted to choose a key sharing method.
Sharing via broadcast chat will send the key over the broadcast network to every user on your frequency set. The key will appear as a push notification to each recipient. Sharing via QR code will present a QR code on your device screen for recipients to scan. 
Once your encryption key is shared, recipients will be required to validate the key by either scanning a QR code or entering a PIN presented on your screen. After validation the encryption key may be enabled at any point from the encryption menu. 
IMPORTANT: Simply entering a new key with the same name as the key you wish to receive is not sufficient. The only way to acquire keys is through the encryption key sharing process. One user on your team must create the key and then share and validate that same key with the rest of the team before deployment."</string>
    <string name="faq_default_category_encryption_q3">Can I enable multiple encryption keys?~~~No, you may only enable one encryption key at a time. This means that you will only be able to send an encrypted message with the key that is enabled. However, any encryption key stored in your encryption menu can be used to decrypt incoming broadcast messages.</string>
    <string name="faq_default_category_encryption_q4">Can I re-share an encryption key?~~~As an additional security measure, only the team leader that created the encryption key can re–share the key. You can do this by selecting “Share” from the key details page. As a recipient, you will not be able to share an encryption key.</string>
    <string name="faq_default_category_encryption_q5">What if I receive two broadcast encryption keys with the same name?~~~You can always identify encryption keys by their unique identifier “UUID” from the key details page. This page will also show the date and time this key was added to your device.</string>
    <string name="faq_default_category_encryption_q6">Are automatic location updates encrypted?~~~Automatic location updates are sent as broadcast messages, so these will NOT be automatically encrypted. You will need to enable encryption on broadcast chat before enabling automatic location updates if you would like your location data to be encrypted.</string>
    <string name="faq_default_category_encryption_q7">Can I reuse broadcast encryption keys at a later date?~~~Yes. Once you have added and validated an encryption key, it will remain in your encryption menu to be enabled at a later date until you manually log out of the app.</string>
    <string name="faq_default_category_encryption_q8">Will users on my network see my broadcast messages if they do not share my encryption key?~~~If you have enabled encryption, any message sent over broadcast will not be received by a user who does not share your encryption key. This includes automatic location updates.</string>
    <string name="faq_default_category_encryption_q9">"Should I encrypt my broadcast messages?~~~Please speak with your team leaders to learn more about your organization's encryption policies."</string>
    <string name="faq_entry_airplane_mode">Will goTenna Pro X 2 work while my mobile device is in airplane mode?~~~Yes, goTenna Pro X 2 does not rely on existing network infrastructure. To use goTenna Pro X 2 with a mobile device in airplane mode, manually activate Bluetooth on the mobile device. This will also allow for longer battery life on the mobile device.</string>
    <string name="faq_entry_antenna_directional">Are the Pro X 2 antennas omnidirectional or directional?~~~They are omnidirectional but optimized to radiate best perpendicular to the antenna itself.</string>
    <string name="faq_entry_antenna_placement">"Where should I have my goTenna Pro X 2 while I’m using it for best performance?~~~As high up and unobstructed as possible. We recommend at the top and outside of any equipment.
Preferably, place Pro X 2 around shoulder level to allow the antenna some clearance off the ground as well as an omnidirectional view of its surroundings unimpeded by the body or other equipment."</string>
    <string name="faq_entry_atak_9line">"9-Line (Close Air Support)~~~Is supported only on ATAK MIL with the following limitations:

    <string name="faq_entry_atak_casevac">CASEVAC~~~ •CASEVAC, along with ZMIST and HLZ, is fully supported. Exceeding our payload limitations may cause CASEVAC messages to send in more than one transmission.</string>
    <string name="faq_entry_atak_drawing">"Drawing Tools~~~Are supported with the following limitations/considerations:
 •Polylines may send in more than one transmission if they exceed 8 points or if the combination of points and title exceed the maximum 235 byte payload.
 •You may not use the Free Draw tool, only the rectangular, circle, and polygon shape tools."</string>
    <string name="faq_entry_atak_geo_fence">"GeoFences~~~If you send a shape over the goTenna radio and there is a GeoFence associated with it, the GeoFence will be shared as well. Please note the following limitations:
 •Receiving a shape with a GeoFence that is already active on your device will turn off that GeoFence.
 •The Send functionality in the shape's GeoFence menu does not send the GeoFence over goTenna. You must send the entire shape after configuring the GeoFence.
 •The Custom monitor is limited to CoT 2525B points."</string>
    <string name="faq_entry_atak_mission_packs">"Mission Packs~~~To download and import a Mission Pack into ATAK you must first be connected to a goKit. There is a new option on the main menu that is called \"Show Mission Packs on goKit\". This will display all Mission Packs available to download. Once downloaded you will be prompted to import the Mission Pack into ATAK.
Users can now share Data Packages over the goKit 2 as well using the ‘Deploy’ feature in the plugin."</string>
    <string name="faq_entry_atak_point_dropper">"Point Dropper~~~Is supported with the following limitations/considerations:
 •The following icon pallets are supported: Markers, Mission, Spot Map, Vehicle Models, GeoOps, Google, OSM, FEMA Icons, and Default.
 •Vehicle height and azimuth are supported.
 •Remarks are not supported.
 •Author callsign and timestamp will appear in the appropriate field or in the remarks.
 •Auto–sharing is not enabled."</string>
    <string name="faq_entry_atak_routes">"Routes~~~Are supported with the following limitations/considerations:
 •All route features are supported, but may send in more than one transmission if they exceed 8 points or if the combination of points, titles, and remarks exceed the maximum 235 byte payload."</string>
    <string name="faq_entry_atak_tactical_chat">Tactical Chat~~~Group messaging, 1–1 chat, and All Channels chat are all supported. Streaming channel is not supported. If you are connected to a TAK server you may multicast messages, but recipients’ ATAK app will filter out duplicate messages.</string>
    <string name="faq_entry_automatic_location_sharing">"Automatic Location Sharing (Blue Force Tracking)~~~Automatic sharing is active by default at a 60 second timer. You may only edit the frequency/mode of location sharing within the goTenna plugin interface.
The position markers also indicate if a user is only a goTenna node via a goTenna logo overlaid on the marker.
Note: PLI markers sent over goTenna stale out in correlation to recipient’s PLI frequency. PLI markers stale out 4.5 times the recipient’s selected PLI rate."</string>
    <string name="faq_entry_bandwidth">What is bandwidth?~~~This is the occupied bandwidth of the goTenna Pro X 2 signals. You may select 7.28 and 11.8 kHz bandwidths. Only one bandwidth is possible per frequency set, so all channels selected within it will operate at that same width. Frequencies on the frequency set should be spread by their corresponding bandwidth spacing i.e. 0.025 MHz with a 11.8 kHz bandwidth selection and 0.0125 MHz with a 7.28 kHz bandwidth selection.</string>
    <string name="faq_entry_bandwidth_performance">"What kind of performance differences should I expect across different bandwidths?~~~The primary differentiator between different bandwidths is the modulated RF data rate that the goTenna protocol is legally allowed to use. The wider the bandwidth, the higher the data rate. With higher data rates you should expect lower latency between communications, and you will also be able to effectively support more users in the field. With our 30–second personal location update use–case model, we expect you will be able to support 6, 8, and 12 users across 4.54, 7.28, and 11.8 kHz respectively.
At times you may see longer range on the slower and narrower bandwidths; however, this will vary widely. Battery life will also be extended on wider/faster bandwidths. We recommend you operate on the widest bandwidth possible to optimize for latency, node support, and battery life."</string>
    <string name="faq_entry_battery_life">"What is the battery life of goTenna Pro X 2?~~~Battery life during active use will vary like any other radio. goTenna Pro X 2 is optimized for teams of 6–12 users sharing locations every 30 seconds, which results in approximately 9 hours of battery life.
Battery life can be extended by reducing your location ping rates and those of your team, which may be relayed through your device – or reducing active nodes as well. Essentially, the battery life will range from roughly 9–40 hours, with the primary factor being your personal location ping rates although heavy ad–hoc chatter can also affect your battery life as well as that of others on the network."</string>
    <string name="faq_entry_bluetooth_disconnects">"I’m getting a lot of Bluetooth disconnects, how can I make it better?~~~Bluetooth Low–Energy is a radio like any other and as such, distance and obstacles will weaken your Bluetooth signal. We recommend keeping your phone and Pro X 2 device as close to each other and unimpeded as possible to ensure the best connection quality.
By design, Pro X 2 is intended to be on your body, preferably around shoulder level and on the same side of your body as the phone it's paired with.

This doesn't mean, however, that the Bluetooth connection won't work if Pro X 2 is on your backpack and your phone is in your front pocket, but you can increase the reliability of the connection if you bring phone and Pro X 2 closer together.

The goTenna Pro X 2 is equipped with enhanced BLE range, however, the same natural Bluetooth variables may still factor into range."</string>
    <string name="faq_entry_bluetooth_security">Should I be worried about Bluetooth security?~~~No. All encryption on the goTenna system occurs within the smartphone application. By the time transmissions hit the Bluetooth layer, they are already fully encrypted. No keys or encryption are ever stored or processed on goTenna hardware.</string>
    <string name="faq_entry_callsign">What is a callsign?~~~This is the identifier assigned to you on your regulatory license. In the US, this is assigned by the FCC, however your country or mission may require different data, or no data, to be input here – as such this is not a required field and does not affect communications.</string>
    <string name="faq_entry_charge_power_off">Can I turn off the computer if I’m not using it to save power, but continue to charge my Pro X 2 units?~~~Both the goKit 1 and goKit 2 have a separate computer power switch. In the goKit 1, this power switch will turn the computer off. In the goKit 2, this power switch will stop the tablet from charging and the tablet will run on its internal battery. This switch can be used to save power for charging the plugged in goTenna Pro X and Pro X 2 radios.</string>
    <string name="faq_entry_charge_time">How long will goTenna Pro X 2 take to charge?~~~The Pro X 2 will charge fully within 4–6 hours depending on the current supplied by your USB charger.</string>
    <string name="faq_entry_communication">"Can goTenna Pro X 2 communicate with other goTenna models or with people who don’t have goTenna?~~~No, different models of goTenna (first–gen goTenna, goTenna Mesh) all operate on different frequencies and cannot communicate with each other. Mobile devices without paired goTenna Pros cannot receive goTenna Pro X 2's radio signals."</string>
    <string name="faq_entry_control_channels">"What are control channels?~~~Control channels are the primary “meeting point” frequencies that the ad–hoc network forms itself on. It does not convey any kind of special control capabilities or anything related to security — it is purely a protocol function.
We recommend that your control channels have the least possibility for interference of any channels you have available as they are the nexus points for initiating communications. If your control channel has too much interference/traffic on it, it can result in latency or inability to communicate over goTenna Pro X 2.
You may set up to 3 different control channels to make the likelihood of interference affecting your operations significantly smaller as the goTenna protocol will cognitively sense its eligible transmission frequencies and will select the best open one for communications.
If you cannot predict interference we recommend spacing out your control channels widely."</string>
    <string name="faq_entry_cross_frequency_comms">Can I communicate with others that are on different frequency sets?~~~No, your entire team must have the same frequency set active at the same time to communicate.</string>
    <string name="faq_entry_data_channels">What is a data channel?~~~Data channels are the channels that the goTenna protocol may select for transmitting the primary data payloads. We recommend setting at least 2 data channels to give the protocol some space to avoid possible interference from other transmitters.</string>
    <string name="faq_entry_delete_frequency_set">How can I delete a frequency set?~~~Frequency sets can be deleted by holding down the intended set. You will be prompted with a confirmation if you want to delete the set or not. You cannot delete your Default frequency sets.</string>
    <string name="faq_entry_encryption">Can I encrypt messages that are transmitted over goTenna?~~~Yes, encryption can be activated through the Encryption Keys menu. To generate an AES 256 key click the \"+\" button and enter a key name (the key name is not the actual encryption key). To share the encryption key you can click on the key you wish to share and acquire a key via QR Code. IMPORTANT: Simply entering a new key with the same name as the key you wish to receive is not sufficient. The only way to acquire keys are through QR codes shared within the goTenna plugin.</string>
    <string name="faq_entry_expected_range">"What is the expected range of goTenna Pro X 2?~~~This is perhaps the most common question about goTenna Pro X 2's performance, but also one of the most difficult to answer.
Range can vary widely based on your environment. For instance, being high up on a hill/mountain with clear line–of–sight is going to provide significantly greater range than what you'll find in a dense urban location surrounded by steel and concrete.
Given this, we believe the most honest answer is to tell users to expect single–hop range to be comparable to other radios operating at similar power, on similar frequencies, similar antennas, and similar environments.
With meshing, however, this can be significantly extended. We also encourage users to focus less on range and more on our core use case. The goTenna Pro X 2 system is primarily designed for intra–team communication among groups of dismounted operators, and in such a mission profile, the distance between team members is often significantly lower than the kilometers/miles Pro X 2's distance is regularly measured in."</string>
    <string name="faq_entry_firmware_update">What is a firmware update?~~~Firmware is the software running on the goTenna Pro X 2 hardware that enables it to operate. Firmware updates are relatively rare compared to app updates , but when they are available we highly encourage users to execute them as they often offer significant enhancements to stability and performance. Firmware updates take 4–15 minutes depending on the host phone. The fastest updates will execute on newer phone models that support the Bluetooth Low–Energy 5 (BT5) protocol. Firmware updates will also execute automatically via the USB charger/data connector if you have a goTenna Deployment Kit (goKit).</string>
    <string name="faq_entry_frequency_coverage">What frequencies do the goTenna Pro X 2 antennas cover?~~~GoTenna offers two custom antennas, one covering the VHF ranges of 142–175 MHz, and another covering the UHF 445–480 MHz range. The VHF antenna is roughly 10 inches long, while the UHF is smaller around 6 inches long.</string>
    <string name="faq_entry_frequency_cross_usage">Can I use the UHF antenna while set on VHF frequencies or vice versa?~~~Not really. Although technically nothing will break, your performance will be very poor as the antennas are not tuned to radiate efficiently outside of their frequency range. Expect extremely limited range if operating on mismatched antennas.</string>
    <string name="faq_entry_frequency_set">What is a frequency set?~~~A frequency set is a collection of RF settings that are required to operate goTenna Pro X 2. They include variables such as frequencies for operation, power levels, and other technical RF details that should only be of concern for service users and admins. For more information see the “Advanced Tuning” section of the FAQs. Note: You will only see this section of the FAQs if you are enabled as a service user.</string>
    <string name="faq_entry_frequency_set_source">Where do I get frequency sets from, and can I edit or make new ones?~~~Frequency sets are automatically downloaded from the portal upon initial setup and login. They may also be acquired from a goTenna Deployment Kit or a service user. Only service users can edit or create new frequency sets. Regular users may only toggle between frequency sets they already have.</string>
    <string name="faq_entry_frequency_set_usage">As an end-user, what do I do with frequency sets?~~~As an end–user, the only information relevant to frequency sets is the name of the active frequency set. You only need to ensure that you have the same frequency set active as the rest of your team. You are free to toggle between different frequency sets; however, only a user with service permissions can edit these settings.</string>
    <string name="faq_entry_frequency_sharing">"Can I share frequency settings over the air?~~~Yes, you may send a new frequency set to your team as an “attachment” to a message just like you can with map objects and locations. This will not work for non–provisioned users however as they would not be on the proper initial frequency set to receive your OTA share. This will only work for users that are already on a frequency set together but need to get a new one en masse. The OTA sharing will allow this quickly, and then users must toggle it active just like QR scans. Within ATAK the OTA share option can be found within the frequency set detail screen's overflow menu in the upper right corner."</string>
    <string name="faq_entry_frequency_variation">Can slightly different settings on different frequency sets still communicate?~~~Metadata fields such as frequency set names and FCC callsigns can vary — however, you must have identical RF settings to communicate with other Pro X 2 units. The frequencies and bandwidths must be precisely the same , including in the same order. Ie, if frequency 155MHz is data channel 1 and 160MHz is data channel 2, all others must be exactly the same. A radio with 155 as channel 2 and 160 as channel 1 will not be able to communicate. The only RF parameter that can deviate is output power, but this is not recommended as it will result in disparate link quality across nodes that can result in inconsistent communications.</string>
    <string name="faq_entry_gid">What is a GID?~~~GID stands for “goTenna ID”, which is the unique identifier for your phone and device across the goTenna Pro X 2 network. It is how people find and address you when using our native app, our ATAK plugin does not use this identifier system and instead relies on native ATAK call–signs which are only used within the encrypted primary data transmissions.</string>
    <string name="faq_entry_gokit">What is the goTenna Deployment Kit?~~~The goKit is a self-enclosed off-grid goTenna Pro provisioning system. It allows for the off-grid installation of Android apps, downloading of maps and data packages, and hosts frequency sets and encryption keys to provision users after installing the apps if a service user is not available. It also provides charging, firmware upgrades, and safe storage/transportation for up to 30 goTenna Pro units enabling rapid off-grid deployment anywhere.</string>
    <string name="faq_entry_gokit_access">Can I access the computer within the goKit for my own applications?~~~The goKit 2 uses an Android tablet that comes standard with the goKit application. It can also be used as a regular Android tablet, with all the abilities that any Android device would possess.</string>
    <string name="faq_entry_gokit_auto_sync">"Can I shut off the automatic syncing of the goKit with the Portal?~~~Yes you may within the goKit's settings screen. We recommend you do this if you are ever operating on a small or expensive data link like the satellite hub and do not want something like a new app download to go over the link until a later date when you're on a more appropriate internet connection better suited for large file transmissions."</string>
    <string name="faq_entry_gokit_charging">Can I charge my phone and other devices off the goKit?~~~Yes, there are 4 auxiliary USB power ports.</string>
    <string name="faq_entry_gokit_commercial_flight">Can the goKit fly on commercial aircraft? Can it go as a carry-on?~~~Yes, the goKit is designed to conform to FAA requirements for overhead compartments. This includes not only its dimensions and weight, but also its battery. The goKit can fly without any issue in even the smallest of regional aircraft. Please note that overhead compartment policies vary from carrier to carrier as many do not adhere to FAA standards, so we encourage you to check with your airline to ensure carry–on is OK.</string>
    <string name="faq_entry_gokit_deploy_time">How long does it take for the goKit to deploy an app to a smartphone?~~~The deployment is done wirelessly via WiFi and the time it will take to download the app to a phone will depend on the size of the application. Applications of average size (50–80 MB) require about 30–45 seconds to download – please note that download times and reliability can vary like any WiFi connection. With many users connected, download times will slow. Furthermore in congested WiFi environments downloads can slow and sometimes require restarting.</string>
    <string name="faq_entry_gokit_frequency_get">How do I get frequencies from a goKit?~~~goKit 2 users can share frequencies via ‘Deploy” by creating a deployment pack, adding a frequency set, and sharing this through a WiFi hotspot. Recipients must go through ‘Deploy’>Receive to connect to this WiFi hotspot and receive the frequency set.</string>
    <string name="faq_entry_gokit_lock">Can I lock the goKit?~~~Yes, the goKit is built on a custom Nanuk ruggedized case that includes locking through–holes where you can easily place a lock, zip tie, or other securing mechanism. The latches are also very secure and will not come undone without deliberate action.</string>
    <string name="faq_entry_gokit_over_gotenna">Will the goKit communicate over goTenna itself?~~~The goKit 2 can communicate over goTenna by installing ATAK plug our goTenna plugin or the goTenna Pro App and connecting a goTenna Pro X 2 radio via Bluetooth or USB. The goKit 1 cannot communicate over goTenna itself as a node.</string>
    <string name="faq_entry_gokit_ports">What ports are available to work with the goKit’s computer?~~~There are SD card, Ethernet, USB, and WiFi interface options.</string>
    <string name="faq_entry_gokit_purpose">What is the primary purpose of the goTenna Deployment Kit?~~~The primary purpose of the goKit is to enable a user–friendly system for the set up of goTenna Pro X 2 operators in completely disconnected environments. It is an off–grid application distribution system — put more simply, it is an off–grid app store. The goKit hosts not only the goTenna Pro X app, but it can also host any other apps that organizations want to deploy and use off–grid. The goKit receives its apps and updates from the goTenna Management Portal when connected to the internet, but when offline it sets up its own WiFi hotspot that Android and iOS phones can connect to for an easy automated installation of any of the locally hosted apps on the goKit. This solves the chicken/egg problem where Pro X 2 units might be available, but new users might not have installed an appropriate goTenna–compatible app before going offline. With the goKit, this problem is solved. Soon the goKit will allow off–line distribution of map data and other mission packages as well.</string>
    <string name="faq_entry_gokit_simultaneous_install">How many people can install the app simultaneously?~~~Theoretically the max connection for WiFi is 255 users, though like any other wireless system, it will slow significantly with too many users. We have tested up to 10 simultaneous installs without issue— it just takes a bit longer to complete.</string>
    <string name="faq_entry_gokit_spare_storage">Is there spare storage space inside the goKit?~~~Yes, there is space designed to hold at least 30 goTenna Pro antennas plus some spare space. Next to the charging bay, you will find a small storage locker that is secured with a metal latch.</string>
    <string name="faq_entry_gokit_storage_mode">What is storage mode?~~~The goKit has 3 primary power modes. On, storage, and off. While on storage mode the goKit will operate as if it is in ON mode but only if it is connected to external power (AC or 12V). If that external power is ever interrupted it will shut off automatically. This is the recommended mode to leave your goKit when not in use. This allows the goKit to continue to be connected to the portal, receive and execute updates, and do its normal operations without consuming its internal battery. If the external power is ever cut because of an emergency or someone has to rapidly get the Kit to deploy, we shut off the power right away to not waste any energy when it only has its internal power to rely on. This will ensure that no matter what your goKit is always fully charged, updated, and ready to go no matter what. When connected to external power, ON and standby modes are indistinguishable. ON should of course be used when no external power is available.</string>
    <string name="faq_entry_gokit_waterproof">Is the case waterproof? How rugged is it?~~~Yes it is waterproof, but only when closed of course. It is also tested for drops from up to 3 feet in the air. Like any other electronic device, we encourage you to avoid drop testing it unless absolutely necessary.</string>
    <string name="faq_entry_gps">"Does goTenna Pro X 2 have its own GPS capabilities?~~~No, all location data is leveraged from the smartphone. If you choose to leave a Pro X 2 unit as a relay node somewhere we recommend you drop a map marker to track where it was left as you won't be able to ping it for its location at a later time."</string>
    <string name="faq_entry_indicator_light">What do the indicator lights on the Pro X 2 mean?~~~When first turned on, the Pro X 2 will blink repeatedly to indicate pairing mode. Upon connecting to a mobile device , the light will shut off to conserve power. Tapping on the power button while the device is on and connected will make the light flash — this is an indicator that the device is on and connected to a phone.</string>
    <string name="faq_entry_light_off">Can the lights be turned off?~~~Yes, you may turn off the lights on the goTenna Pro X 2. The option is within the settings of your application. If you toggle the lights off, you will no longer receive any feedback from normal operation (i.e. receipt, sending, disconnected Bluetooth, etc.). You can, however, still manually hit the test/ping button in the app to confirm your connection to the device. The light triggered by the physical button will also be deactivated, which may make it difficult to tell if it has been shut off. For this we recommend just ensuring you hold the button for at least 5 seconds — you can turn it back on to check if necessary. To exit lights–off mode you must either turn off the option in your app, or you can power cycle your device and it will return to its default light patterns. Please note that if your device is power cycled and then connects back to a phone that still has the lights–off mode enabled, it will resume that mode immediately upon connecting to the phone.</string>
    <string name="faq_entry_listen_only">What is Listen Only Mode?~~~While in Listen Only Mode, a user can see other message and location data being passed through the network, but will not be able to share their location or send message. A user in listen–only mode will also NOT mesh any data for others – they will have zero RF signature. This allows for much more complex and technically infinitely scalable networks, as well as quiet operations. You can enable and disable this feature from Device Settings.</string>
    <string name="faq_entry_maintain_frequency">Will the goTenna Pro X 2 maintain its active frequency set when it is powered off?~~~Yes, the Pro X 2 will maintain the active frequency set of the previous mobile device to which is was paired.</string>
    <string name="faq_entry_map_object">"What happens if I edit a map object?~~~Edits you make will only be viewable to you unless you share them. This is as simple as re–sending the map object you edited so people get your updates. 
Please note that the goTenna Pro X 2 app will only display the last map object update. If a user in your team pushes out an update to a map object it will override other users’ local update(s) that they may not have shared."</string>
    <string name="faq_entry_missed_data">"If a user misses a shared map object, message, tracking item or other notification because they were out of range or their device was off, will their application update with missed data when they come back into the network?~~~No, as an ad–hoc system with no central server, there is no local repository of data that goes out over the goTenna Pro X 2 network. This is not an issue for personnel tracks, however, as they go out periodically and have limited utility beyond a few minutes.
For important transmissions, users must manually choose to resend that data when the intended recipient is available to update them."</string>
    <string name="faq_entry_multiple_frequency_sets">Can my team be on multiple frequency sets at a time?~~~No, only one frequency set may be active at a time.</string>
    <string name="faq_entry_no_antenna">Will the Pro X 2 operate without an antenna attached?~~~No.</string>
    <string name="faq_entry_no_antenna_transmission">What will happen if I transmit without an antenna attached?~~~The Pro X 2 is also designed to prevent damage to itself in the event of a user inadvertently attempting to transmit without an antenna attached. However, we still recommend avoiding transmission without an attached antenna</string>
    <string name="faq_entry_no_phone">Will goTenna Pro X 2 operate without a phone?~~~Yes, but only as a relay node for others — it will not be able to generate any data on its own, like GPS, which comes from the mobile phone. It can also store messages intended for the last mobile device that connected to it. To leave a Pro X 2 unit as a relay node, you must first pair it with a smartphone, and you must ensure it is tuned to the active frequency set you are operating on.</string>
    <string name="faq_entry_non_service_tuning">"How can I tune/provision a non-service user?~~~You may go into your frequency settings and select the frequency set you would like to share/tune to another user. Select the frequency set then press the share button within its details screen. This will display a QR code. The end user must then activate their frequency set QR scanner from their own RF settings page.
The end user will have the frequency set instantly available upon scanning your QR code. The user must still manually toggle that frequency set active to use it. Scanning only acquires a new frequency setting, it does not activate it. For users that have not on–boarded before and thus cannot reach their RF tuning screen, there is a small “offline setup” link at the bottom of the portal login screen which will activate the QR scanner and allow them to set up completely offline."</string>
    <string name="faq_entry_num_users">"How many users can goTenna Pro X 2 support?~~~Out–of–the–box, the Pro X 2 system is designed to support intra–team communications for small tactical dismounted teams of operators. For our primary use–case, which is modeled around automated blue–force tracking sent out every 30 seconds plus some extra room for ad–hoc manual messaging. It can support up to 12 users at 11.8Khz. We have had success supporting larger groups up to 60 users with all users at 2 minute PLIs with little to no network drops.
Although virtually infinite numbers can be deployed using advanced architectures, we encourage users to try to stick to this use case model as a starting point. Topology, network traffic, and relay placement will have a significant impact on network size.

If your mission requires larger deployments, please contact us at prosupport@gotenna.com for details regarding how to support larger quantities of users with goTenna technology."</string>
    <string name="faq_entry_offline_setup">How can I get set up offline?~~~A service or goKit user must provide you with a frequency set using QR codes. You may connect to a goKit. To connect to a goKit, go to the “Offline Setup” link at the bottom of the portal login screen during onboarding. This will provide you with an option to set up from the goKit.</string>
    <string name="faq_entry_other_antennas">"Can I use other non-goTenna antennas or connectors on the Pro X 2?~~~Yes, you may use any standard 50–ohm antenna or connector with the goTenna Pro X 2 system — just ensure that the antennas you use are tuned to cover the proper frequencies you are operating at. You should also ensure that any third–party antenna is rated to handle the output power of your goTenna Pro X 2.
5 watts at maximum power is very high — this could cause a burn out of your antenna thus significantly reduced range. Also note that not all antennas are made equal — although they may claim to cover the proper frequency ranges, the actual efficiency of a third–party antenna cannot be guaranteed."</string>
    <string name="faq_entry_out_of_range">How can I know if someone on my team, including me, goes out of range?~~~It is not possible to <b>immediately</b>" confirm if a user has gone out of range, however you can receive periodic updates. goTenna Pro X 2 is a truly ad–hoc network, this means it does not maintain continuous data links between users, due to this we cannot know the precise moment that someone goes out of range.

For example, if a team member is pinging their location every 30 seconds, if they do not refresh their location within 90 seconds of the first missed report, the native app will mark them as grey on the map allowing you to automatically and visually know they have gone out of range.
Conversely, if you see everyone on your team go grey, then you know you are the one that has gone out of range."</string>
    <string name="faq_entry_output_power">What is output power?~~~This is the output power that the goTenna Pro X 2 will transmit when on a specific frequency set. You have the option of 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 5W modes. At this time the goTenna Pro will operate at a fixed output power, a future update will scale power cognitively.</string>
    <string name="faq_entry_output_power_performance">What kind of performance differences should I expect using different output power levels?~~~Different power levels will not noticeably affect battery life, but they will affect range. The difference between the lowest power level (0.5W) and the highest (5W) is about 10 dB, which in practice can manifest itself in anywhere from 2 to 6X range differences. Like always, range and penetration cannot be accurately predicted due to great variances in the environment. We encourage users to test in their own locations to identify their effective differences.</string>
    <string name="faq_entry_portal_updates">Will my new frequency sets or edits populate to the Portal?~~~No, any frequency sets created or edited on a local service user device are never pushed up to the portal. Whenever you edit a frequency set you make a new local one based off of the original from the portal. You can reset back to the portal defaults at any time.</string>
    <string name="faq_entry_power_off">How do I turn goTenna Pro X 2 off?~~~Hold the power button until the light turns on. Continue to hold until the light turns off.</string>
    <string name="faq_entry_power_on">How do I turn goTenna Pro X 2 on?~~~Hold the power button on the right side until the light turns on and begins to pulsate slowly to indicate it is on and in pairing mode.</string>
    <string name="faq_entry_relay_mode">What is Relay Mode?~~~A powered goTenna Pro X 2 device can receive and relay messages as well as location data. goTenna Pro X 2 does NOT need to be actively paired to a smartphone to serve as a relay node, but it does have to be powered on. This enables users to use goTenna Pro X 2 devices as stationary relay points in strategic locations to increase range – they will do this during normal operation, even when not in the specifically designated “relay mode” Relay mode is simply a mode that turns off the light/Bluetooth to conserve power, and wipes the GID value to prevent false acknowledgement when using breadcrumbs with the same host device when using our native app – it is not relevant to our ATAK implementation. To turn Relay Mode on, press the power button 3 times when the unit is on. Wait until the LED light is solid. Then press the power button again 3 times to confirm. Make sure that the sequence is correct otherwise you might accidentally trigger the emergency beacon feature which uses 5 presses to activate. To exit out of Relay Mode, power cycle the unit by holding down the power button for 3 seconds and then release.</string>
    <string name="faq_entry_rugged">How rugged is the goTenna Pro X 2? Is it waterproof?~~~The goTenna Pro X 2 is impact, shock, and waterproof. It is rated to IP68 down to 30 feet of water for up to 1 hour.</string>
    <string name="faq_entry_service_user">What is a service user?~~~A service user is a user whose permissions enabled in the goTenna app allow them to edit or create new frequency sets in the field independent of the management portal. They may also share their frequencies with other users in the field that need to be provisioned off–grid when portal access is unavailable. Service users should only be trained subject matter experts who understand RF and the goTenna Pro X 2 system well.</string>
    <string name="faq_entry_service_user_permission_check">How do I know if I have service user permissions?~~~Inside your app the options to edit and share frequencies from the frequency set tuning screen will become available. Basic users can only toggle between sets. You will also see the Advanced Tuning FAQ section.</string>
    <string name="faq_entry_service_user_permission_get">How do I get service user permissions?~~~Service user permissions can only be provisioned by the organizational admin within the goTenna Management Portal. You must contact your Portal Admin and request to have service user permissions activated to be provisioned as a service user. Once activated, you must log into the portal via an appropriate goTenna app to receive your configurations and permissions.</string>
    <string name="faq_entry_single_frequency">Can I use a single frequency for both data and control?~~~Yes, you may. However, setting multiple frequencies, preferably with wide spacing across them, will result in more reliable field performance in the face of jamming/interference.</string>
    <string name="faq_entry_third_party_antenna">How can I tell if a 3rd party antenna is good or not?~~~Pro X 2 includes an automatic antenna quality checking mechanism that is reported in your app. Note that the measurements are approximate. Testing is the best way to tell, although our notification may help you narrow down issues faster.</string>
    <string name="faq_entry_tune_before_use">"Do I need to tune to a frequency set before I can operate? Is there a default frequency setting that can work without a custom frequency set for my team?~~~There is no default frequency setting to operate on as all frequencies covered by goTenna Pro X 2 require a license specific to the end user's organization. A frequency set is a prerequisite to operation, and it can be acquired online from the Portal login, or offline from a goKit or service user that has been provisioned as such from the portal before going offline."</string>
    <string name="faq_entry_tuning">How does tuning goTenna Pro X 2 work?~~~GoTenna Pro X 2 is a software–defined radio that can change a multitude of its radio settings (what we call tuning) based on settings commands that it gets from its master application in the smartphone.</string>
    <string name="faq_entry_unauth_access">"What happens if a hostile or otherwise unauthorized user gains access to a goTenna Pro X 2 device that I have left behind as a relay/breadcrumb node? Can they access my network?~~~goTenna Pro X 2 devices left behind as nodes in a mesh network do not present any kind of security/access threat to your network. This is because they do not have any encryption keys stored locally on them. Even if a hostile actor were to have their own goTenna–compatible app and connected to a left–behind node, they wouldn't be able to retrieve or decrypt any data. The worst thing that would happen is that they could take down your relay node from the network."</string>
    <string name="faq_entry_unregulated_power">Can the goKit handle unregulated power sources? How is it charged?~~~The goKit can be charged via an auxiliary 12V port (cigarette lighter) as well as through a standard AC power port available on its backside.</string>
    <string name="faq_entry_usb">"Can I connect my goTenna Pro X 2 using USB?~~~Yes, provided that you have the correct Android phone and cable. Your Android phone has to support USB Host mode and you must use an well–shielded OTG cable. If pairing through USB is supported, you will be prompted to connect using USB when attempting to pair. If you don't see the prompt try checking your device's connected USB settings. If you don't see these settings your phone might not support USB Host mode."</string>
